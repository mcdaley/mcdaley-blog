Before architecturing a system perform some back of the envelope math to
calculate the amount of users and transactions that you expect to have
at product launch and within the first one to three years.

Many times systems are made to complicated before all of the business rules
are known and/or defined. The over designing of the system can increase the
time to market by increasing development and testing time. Many times a
simple architecture will meet your performance goals.
